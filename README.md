#🚀 Concepts and Learnings
This project helped me understand and implement various React.js concepts, including:

1. useState
Managed the state for:
Password length.
Inclusion of numbers and special characters.
The generated password.
2. useEffect
Automatically generated a new password whenever the settings (length, numbers, or characters) changed by listening to state updates.
3. useCallback
Improved performance by freezing function instances to prevent unnecessary re-creations:
Used in the password generation and clipboard copying logic.
