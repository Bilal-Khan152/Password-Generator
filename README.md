## 🚀 Concepts and Learnings

This project helped me explore and understand key **React.js** concepts:

### 1. `useState`
- Used to manage:
  - Password length.
  - Options for including numbers and special characters.
  - The generated password itself.

### 2. `useEffect`
- Automatically re-generates a password whenever state changes occur (like toggling options or adjusting length).

### 3. `useCallback`
- Improved performance by memoizing functions:
  - Prevented unnecessary re-creations of the password generator logic.
  - Ensured the clipboard copy functionality remained efficient.
